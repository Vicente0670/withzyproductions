## Development
<a href="https://skillicons.dev"><img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,ts,next,git"/></a>

[WithZyProductions.com](https://withzyproductions.com/) was developed using [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/).
If (*for whatever reason*) you want to host the website locally, you can do so by following a few simple steps, assuming you have Git installed:

### 1. Choose where to drop the repository
Simply open the desired folder that you want the project to fall into. We're installing the repository via the Git Bash.
Personally, I would use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download, but the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) works, too.
### 2. Clone the repository
In Git Bash, copy and paste the following command:
```git
git clone https://github.com/Vicente0670/withzyproductions
```
This should clone the entire repository to the current directory.
### 3. Run the project
Run the local server using the following commands (*according to Next.js's README*):
```c
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Once you've done that, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your web browser, and you should see the entirety of the website.
You can now modify the project on your computer at will.
